- **Fixes `direct login disabled` error**: Fixes an error that sometimes occurs during the session refresh process. This is due to the fact that very experienced campus developers have not been able to fix this bug for years, which occurs due to an extra slash in the URL - `https://campus.kpi.ua//login.php`
